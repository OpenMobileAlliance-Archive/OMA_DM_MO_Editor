The aim of the `Objects and Resources Editor` is to create **DM** `Objects` & `Resources` and then export them into other formats without having to re-create them again.

The Editor tool is hosted by OMA at: [`DM MO Editor tool`](http://devtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/DMEditor/). 
* TS Template for OMA Working Groups – This document contains an OMA Technical Specification template that MUST be used by the OMA Working Groups to guarantee that the eMO tool can extract the defined Management Object from the OMA Technical Specification [`Download`](http://member.openmobilealliance.org/ftp/Public_documents/DM/Permanent_documents/OMA-TEMPLATE-MO_TS-20160318-I.zip). 
* TS template for External Organisations – This template should be used by other Standard Development Organization or companies to guarantee that the eMO tool can extract the defined Management Object from the document [`Download`](http://member.openmobilealliance.org/ftp/Public_documents/DM/Permanent_documents/OMA-Ext-Temp-MO_Spec_V1_0-20160318-I.zip). 

The tool will allow the submission of new Objects and Resources to [`OMNA LwM2M Registry`](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/omna/omna-dm-mo-registry). 

The GitHub repository for this tool is: [`OMA LwM2M Object & Resource Editor Tool - Code.`](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA-Objects-Resources-Editor)
